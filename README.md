  ## Description
  This project is a README generator for developers and helps them quickly create a professional README for a new project. First, this is a command-line application that accepts user input: After downloading this repo, the user input "npm install" to initialize the files and run "index.js". When the user is prompted for information about my application repository, then a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of that project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions. Second, when the user enters the project title, the title will be displayed as the title of the README. When the user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, this information will be added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests. Third, when the user chooses a license for that project, a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under. Last, the user's GitHub username & email which answered earlier, will be added to the section of the README entitled Contact, with links to that user's GitHub profile and email address. When visitors click on the links in the Table of Contents, the section titles can take them to the corresponding section of the README.
